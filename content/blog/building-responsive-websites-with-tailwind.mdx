# Building Responsive Websites with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS has revolutionized the way we build modern websites. In this article, we'll explore how to create responsive, maintainable, and beautiful websites using Tailwind CSS.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, which means:

## Getting Started

First, install Tailwind CSS in your project:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow when using Tailwind CSS:

1. **Use Custom Components**
   Extract commonly used patterns into components to maintain consistency.

2. **Responsive Design**
   Utilize Tailwind's responsive modifiers to create mobile-first designs:

   ```jsx
   <div className="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
     Responsive text that scales with screen size
   </div>
   ```

3. **Dark Mode**
   Implement dark mode with Tailwind's dark modifier:

   ```jsx
   <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800">
     Content that adapts to dark mode
   </div>
   ```
