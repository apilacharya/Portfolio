# Complete Guide to Next.js App Router

Next.js App Router represents a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. This guide will help you understand the key concepts and best practices.

## What is App Router?

The App Router is Next.js's new routing system built on React Server Components. It provides:

- First-class support for React Server Components
- Built-in data fetching
- Nested layouts and routes
- Improved performance through streaming

## Key Features

### 1. Server Components

```jsx
// app/page.tsx
export default async function Home() {
  const data = await getData(); // This runs on the server!
  return <h1>{data.title}</h1>;
}
```

### 2. Nested Layouts

```jsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 3. Data Fetching

Next.js 13+ simplifies data fetching with built-in functions:

```jsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  return res.json();
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use Server Components by default
2. Client Components when needed (interactivity)
3. Colocate data fetching with components
4. Leverage streaming for improved UX

## Conclusion

The App Router is a powerful tool that helps build better React applications. Understanding these concepts will help you make the most of Next.js's capabilities.
